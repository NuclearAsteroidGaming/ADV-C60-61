            My hobby is drawing, I draw in my free time. Drawing helps me relax and stops me from getting bored. I like to draw realistic things and nature. Drawing helps you observe things better. This is something that is good to do after school or whenever you are bored. Drawing is something that I like and it is fun. You can easily draw with a few drawing courses, youtube videos, and more.

            According to research from the National Center of Biotechnology Information, drawing enables the ability to think in a different manner, encouraging open-ended thought and creativity.

            In addition to creativity, there are cognitive and cerebral benefits to sketching. We use our brains when we draw, and this not only releases endorphins, but helps build new connections and pathways. When drawing, we actively use both sides of our brain, the right for creativity, and the left for logical thinking. This strengthens both and helps develop the ability to focus and think strategically.

            Drawing, like many other art forms, aids in relaxation and stress relief by forcing us to pay attention to details in the environment, which mimics the experience of mediation. Spontaneous drawing is also said to relieve stress and improve focus, as it relieves your brain from the strain of continuous concentration. This, in turn, allows you to relax.
